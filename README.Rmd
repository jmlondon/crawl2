# crawl2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

After 10+ years, the code base for the R package
[{`crawl`}](https://github.com/NMML/crawl) is showing its age. With that in
mind, Devin Johnson ([dsjohnson](https://github.com/dsjohnson)) and I are
planning to devote some of our time over the next months fleshing out our ideas
for {`crawl2`}.

We're going to start with a code sprint (well, actually, more like a code _jog_)
during the week of **11-15 October 2021** as part of the **7th Int'l Bio-logging
Symposium's Global Collaboration Week**.

If you are a user of {`crawl`} OR have thought about using {`crawl`} OR have
used other approaches for modeling animal movement (e.g. {`foisGras`}, 
{`momentuHMM`}), _we want to hear from you_.

Please take a moment to [Create an Issue](https://github.com/jmlondon/crawl2/issues)
and share your ideas for improvements, feature requests, new directions, etc.
