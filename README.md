# crawl2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

After 10+ years, the code base for the R package
[{`crawl`}](https://github.com/NMML/crawl) is showing its age. With that
in mind, Devin Johnson ([dsjohnson](https://github.com/dsjohnson)) and I
are planning to devote some of our time over the next months fleshing
out our ideas for {`crawl2`}.

We’re going to start with a code sprint (well, actually, more like a
code *jog*) during the week of **11-15 October 2021** as part of the
**7th Int’l Bio-logging Symposium’s Global Collaboration Week**.

If you are a user of {`crawl`} OR have thought about using {`crawl`} OR
have used other approaches for modeling animal movement
(e.g. {`foisGras`}, {`momentuHMM`}), *we want to hear from you*.

Please take a moment to [Create an
Issue](https://github.com/jmlondon/crawl2/issues) and share your ideas
for improvements, feature requests, new directions, etc.
